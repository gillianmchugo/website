abstract: '*Mycobacterium bovis* causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB), an infectious disease
  of cattle that poses a zoonotic threat to humans. Research has shown that bTB susceptibility
  is a heritable trait, and that the peripheral blood (PB) transcriptome is perturbed
  during bTB disease. Hitherto, no study has integrated PB transcriptomic, genomic
  and GWAS data to study bTB disease, and little is known about the genomic architecture
  underpinning the PB transcriptional response to *M. bovis* infection. Here, we perform
  transcriptome profiling of PB from 63 control and 60 confirmed *M. bovis* infected
  animals and detect 2,592 differently expressed genes that perturb multiple immune
  response pathways. Leveraging imputed genome-wide SNP data, we characterise thousands
  of *cis*- and *trans*-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and show that the
  PB transcriptome is substantially impacted by intrapopulation genomic variation.
  We integrate our gene expression data with summary statistics from multiple GWAS
  data sets for bTB susceptibility and perform the first transcriptome-wide association
  study (TWAS) in the context of tuberculosis disease. From this TWAS, we identify
  136 functionally relevant genes (including *RGS10*, *GBP4*, *TREML2*, and *RELT*) and provide
  important new omics data for understanding the host response to mycobacterial infections
  that cause tuberculosis in mammals.'
