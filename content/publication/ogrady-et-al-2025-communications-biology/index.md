abstract: "*Mycobacterium bovis* causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB), an infectious disease
  of cattle that represents a zoonotic threat to humans. Research has shown that the
  peripheral blood (PB) transcriptome is perturbed during bTB disease but the genomic
  architecture underpinning this transcriptional response remains poorly understood.
  Here, we analyse PB transcriptomics data from 63 control and 60 confirmed *M. bovis*-infected
  animals and detect 2592 differently expressed genes perturbing multiple immune response
  pathways. Leveraging imputed genome-wide SNP data, we characterise thousands of
  *cis*-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and show that the PB transcriptome
  is substantially impacted by intrapopulation genomic variation during *M. bovis* infection.
  Integrating our *cis*-eQTL data with bTB susceptibility GWAS summary statistics, we
  perform a transcriptome-wide association study and identify 115 functionally relevant
  genes (including *RGS10*, *GBP4*, *TREML2*, and *RELT*) and provide important new omics
  data for understanding the host response to mycobacterial infections that cause
  tuberculosis in mammals."
