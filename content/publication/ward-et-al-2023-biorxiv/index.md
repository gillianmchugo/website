abstract: Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian colonists to the
  Americas, have been subject to centuries of natural and human-mediated selection
  in novel tropical agroecological zones. Consequently, these breeds have evolved
  distinct characteristics such as resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance.
  In addition to European taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been proposed that
  gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (*Bos indicus*) cattle has shaped the
  ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds from Colombia
  and Venezuela using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure
  and admixture at very high resolution. We did not detect evidence of African taurine
  admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of longstanding zebu ancestry
  in one breed (Hartón del Valle). In addition, we detected selection signatures associated
  with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction,
  fertility, immunity, and distinct coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores
  the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness
  and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease
  challenges. Further research is warranted to leverage these findings for more effective
  and sustainable cattle breeding programmes.
