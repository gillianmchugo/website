abstract: Kerry cattle are an endangered landrace heritage breed of cultural importance
  to Ireland. In the present study we have used genome-wide SNP data (Illumina<sup>Â®</sup> BovineSNP50
  array) to evaluate genomic diversity within the Kerry cattle population and between
  Kerry cattle and other European cattle breeds. Visualisation of patterns of genetic
  differentiation and gene flow among cattle breeds using phylogenetic trees with
  ancestry graphs highlighted, in particular, historical gene flow from the British
  Shorthorn breed into the ancestral population of modern Kerry cattle. Principal
  component analysis (PCA) and genetic clustering emphasised the genetic distinctiveness
  of Kerry cattle relative to comparator British and European cattle breeds. Modelling
  of genetic effective population size (*N*<sub>e</sub>) revealed a demographic trend of diminishing
  *N*<sub>e</sub> over time and that recent estimated *N*<sub>e</sub> values for the Kerry breed may be less
  than the threshold for sustainable genetic conservation. In addition, analysis of
  genome-wide autozygosity (*F*<sub>ROH</sub>) showed that genomic inbreeding has increased significantly
  during the 20 years between 1992 and 2012. Finally, signatures of selection revealed
  genomic regions subject to natural and artificial selection as Kerry cattle adapted
  to the climate, physical geography and agro-ecology of southwest Ireland.
