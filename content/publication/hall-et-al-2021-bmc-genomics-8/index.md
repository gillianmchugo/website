abstract: '**Additional file 8:**<br>**S1 Fig.** Principal component analysis (PCA) plots for
  individual animal bAM gene expression data at **a** 2 hpi, **b** 6 hpi, **c** 24 hpi, and **d**
  48 hpi. **S2 Fig.** Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for functional modules identified
  from the differential co-expression correlation network generated from *M. bovis*-infected
  bAM gene expression at 24 hpi. **S3 Fig.** Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for functional
  modules identified from the differential co-expression correlation network generated
  from *M. bovis*-infected bAM gene expression at 48 hpi. **S4 Fig.** Venn diagram illustrating
  the overlaps for the three 24 hpi input gene sets used for integration with cattle
  GWAS data sets. **S5 Fig.** Venn diagram illustrating the overlaps for the three 48
  hpi input gene sets used for integration with cattle GWAS data sets. RNA-seq statistics
  and results for this study are available at the Dryad Digital Repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9q6.'
