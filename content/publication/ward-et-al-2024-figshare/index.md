abstract: Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian colonists to the
  Americas, have been subject to centuries of natural and human-mediated selection
  in novel tropical agroecological zones. Consequently, these breeds have evolved
  distinct characteristics such as resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance.
  In addition to European taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been proposed that
  gene flow from African taurine and Asian indicine (*Bos indicus*) cattle has shaped
  the ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds from Colombia
  and Venezuela using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism
  (SNP) array data to examine population structure and admixture at high resolution.
  Analysis of genetic structure and ancestry components provided evidence for African
  taurine and Asian indicine admixture in Criollo cattle. In addition, using WGS data,
  we detected selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing
  genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, immunity, and distinct
  coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability
  of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds
  in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges. Further research
  is warranted to leverage these findings for more effective and sustainable cattle
  breeding programmes.
