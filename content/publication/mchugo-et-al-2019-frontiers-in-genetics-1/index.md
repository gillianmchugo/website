abstract: The Galway sheep population is the only native Irish sheep breed and this
  livestock genetic resource is currently categorised as ‘at-risk’. In the present
  study, comparative population genomics analyses of Galway sheep and other sheep
  populations of European origin were used to investigate the microevolution and recent
  genetic history of the breed. These analyses support the hypothesis that British
  Leicester sheep were used in the formation of the Galway. When compared to conventional
  and endangered breeds, the Galway breed was intermediate in effective population
  size, genomic inbreeding and runs of homozygosity. This indicates that, although
  the Galway breed is declining, it is still relatively genetically diverse and that
  conservation and management plans informed by genomic information may aid its recovery.
  The Galway breed also exhibited distinct genomic signatures of artificial or natural
  selection when compared to other breeds, which highlighted candidate genes that
  may be involved in production and health traits.
