abstract: African cattle represent a complex mosaic of *Bos taurus* (taurine) and *Bos
  indicus* (zebu) with most breeds containing varying levels of taurine-zebu admixture.
  The two types of cattle diverged at least 500,000 years ago and significant genomic
  differences have accumulated since that time. One important evolutionary adaptation
  in certain African taurine populations is a genetically determined tolerance to
  infection by trypanosome parasites (*Trypanosoma* spp.), which are transmitted by
  infected tsetse flies (*Glossina* spp.) and cause African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT)
  disease.<br><br>The annual financial burden of AAT is approximately $4.5 billion and AAT
  is one of the largest constraints to livestock rearing in the areas of sub-Saharan
  Africa with significant tsetse densities. The West African *B. taurus* Nâ€™Dama breed
  is trypanotolerant; they have the ability to control parasite loads and to limit
  disease pathology compared to trypanosusceptible zebu breeds. However, *B. indicus*
  or hybrid animals are generally larger, produce higher milk yields and are therefore
  favoured by many farmers. Using local ancestry analysis of genome-wide high-density
  SNP data, we have examined hybrid West African cattle populations to study subchromosomal
  admixture. These results are also integrated with gene expression data from bovine
  trypanosome infection studies to further explore the functional biology of differentially
  introgressed genomic regions.
