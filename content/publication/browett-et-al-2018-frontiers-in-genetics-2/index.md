abstract: Kerry cattle are an endangered landrace heritage breed of cultural importance
  to Ireland. In the present study we have used genome-wide SNP array data to evaluate
  genomic diversity within the Kerry population and between Kerry cattle and other
  European breeds. Patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow among breeds
  using phylogenetic trees with ancestry graphs highlighted historical gene flow from
  the British Shorthorn breed into the ancestral population of modern Kerry cattle.
  Principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic clustering emphasised the genetic
  distinctiveness of Kerry cattle relative to comparator British and European cattle
  breeds. Modelling of genetic effective population size (*N*<sub>e</sub>) revealed a demographic
  trend of diminishing *N*<sub>e</sub> over time and that recent estimated *N*<sub>e</sub> values for the Kerry
  breed may be less than the threshold for sustainable genetic conservation. In addition,
  analysis of genome-wide autozygosity (*F*<sub>ROH</sub>) showed that genomic inbreeding has increased
  significantly during the 20 years between 1992 and 2012. Finally, signatures of
  selection revealed genomic regions subject to natural and artificial selection as
  Kerry cattle adapted to the climate, physical geography and agro-ecology of southwest
  Ireland.
