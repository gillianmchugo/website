abstract: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with *Mycobacterium bovis*,
  is a major disease affecting cattle globally as well as being a zoonotic risk to
  human health. The key innate immune cell that first encounters *M. bovis* is the alveolar
  macrophage, previously shown to be substantially reprogrammed during intracellular
  infection by the pathogen. Here we use multi-omics and network biology approaches
  to analyse the macrophage transcriptional response to *M. bovis* infection and identify
  core infection response pathways and gene modules. These outputs were integrated
  with results from genome-wide associations of *M. bovis* infection to enhance the
  detection of putative genomic variants for disease resistance. Our results show
  that network-based integration of relevant transcriptomics data can extract additional
  information from large genome-wide associations and that this approach could also
  be used to integrate relevant functional genomics outputs with results from genomic
  association studies for human tuberculosis caused by the related *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.
