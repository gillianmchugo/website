abstract: The Galway sheep population is the only native Irish sheep breed and represents
  an important livestock genetic resource, which is currently categorised as “at-risk”.
  In the present study, comparative population genomics analyses of Galway sheep and
  other sheep populations of European origin were used to investigate the microevolution
  and recent genetic history of the breed. These analyses support the hypothesis that
  British Leicester sheep were used in the formation of the Galway breed and suggest
  more recent gene flow from the Suffolk sheep breed. When compared to conventional
  and endangered breeds, the Galway breed was intermediate in effective population
  size, genomic inbreeding and runs of homozygosity. This indicates that, although
  the Galway breed is declining, it is still relatively genetically diverse and that
  conservation and management plans informed by genomic information may aid its recovery.
  The Galway breed also exhibited distinct genomic signatures of artificial or natural
  selection when compared to other breeds, which highlighted candidate genes that
  may be involved in meat and wool production.
