abstract: Conservation of wild and livestock/aquaculture species aims at maximizing
  genetic diversity on the long-term, while selection programs focus mainly on genetic
  improvement in the next generation. Both genetic drift and selection can lead to
  high rates at which inbreeding increases if a small number of individuals contribute
  largely to subsequent generations. Increases in the rate of inbreeding would have
  negative consequences such as reductions of genetic variability and increased risk
  of inbreeding depression that may affect specific genomic regions and that can compromise
  the success of both conservation and selection programs. Traditionally, the control
  of inbreeding has been tracked by managing the relationships between individuals
  using pedigree records. With the advent of new genotyping and high-throughput sequencing
  technologies, obtaining more precise information about the relationships between
  individuals is now possible. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chips or
  genotyping-by-sequencing data contain only a subset of the polymorphic variants
  available in a species, whole genome sequencing data provide access to complete
  information on all the variants of an individual. As a consequence, the estimation
  of coefficients to measure genetic variability may be affected by the type of data
  used for their estimation.<br><br>During the post-genomics era, a variety of methods to
  characterize the levels of genetic diversity from genomic information within and
  between populations have been developed. These are related to the estimation of
  the selection signature and population structure or coefficients to determine the
  increase in inbreeding such as effective population size. However, under this new
  genomic perspective, methods and concepts need to be revised. In parallel to the
  development of genomic tools, traditional and new strategies to control inbreeding
  to simultaneously target conservation of genetic diversity and genetic improvement
  need to be developed or accommodated to the new context. The availability of genomic
  information opens up possibilities to include genome wide marker information in
  prediction of total breeding values and to obtain higher genetic gains through genomic
  selection but controlling the increase of the rate of inbreeding is also necessary
  to ensure the viability of the programs.
