abstract: '*Bos taurus* (taurine) and *Bos indicus* (indicine) cattle diverged at least
  150,000 years ago and, since that time, substantial genomic differences have evolved
  between the two lineages. During the last two millennia, genetic exchange in Africa
  has resulted in a complex tapestry of taurine-indicine ancestry, with most cattle
  populations exhibiting varying levels of admixture. Similarly, there are several
  Southern European cattle populations that also show evidence for historical gene
  flow from indicine cattle, the highest levels of which are found in the Central
  Italian White breeds. Here we use two different software tools (MOSAIC and ELAI)
  for local ancestry inference (LAI) with genome-wide high- and low-density SNP array
  data sets in hybrid African and residually admixed Southern European cattle populations
  and obtained broadly similar results despite critical differences in the two LAI
  methodologies used. Our analyses identified genomic regions with elevated levels
  of retained or introgressed ancestry from the African taurine, European taurine,
  and Asian indicine lineages. Functional enrichment of genes underlying these ancestry
  peaks highlighted biological processes relating to immunobiology and olfaction,
  some of which may relate to differing susceptibilities to infectious diseases, including
  bovine tuberculosis, East Coast fever, and tropical theileriosis. Notably, for retained
  African taurine ancestry in admixed trypanotolerant cattle we observed enrichment
  of genes associated with haemoglobin and oxygen transport. This may reflect positive
  selection of genomic variants that enhance control of severe anaemia, a debilitating
  feature of trypanosomiasis disease, which severely constrains cattle agriculture
  across much of sub-Saharan Africa.'
