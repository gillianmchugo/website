abstract: 'Objectives: Improved bovine tuberculosis (bTB) diagnostics with higher
  sensitivity and specificity are urgently required. A better understanding of the
  peripheral blood transcriptional response of *Mycobacterium bovis*-infected animals
  after bovine purified protein derivative (PPD-b) stimulation of whole blood - an
  important component of current bTB diagnostics - will provide new information for
  development of better diagnostics. Methods: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to
  study the peripheral blood transcriptome after stimulation with PPD-b across four
  time points (-1 wk pre-infection, and +1 wk, +2 wk, and +10 wk post-infection) from
  a 14-week *M. bovis* infection time course experiment with ten age-matched Holstein-Friesian
  cattle. Results: In vitro PPD-b stimulation of peripheral blood from *M. bovis*-infected
  and non-infected cattle elicited a strong transcriptional response. Comparison of
  PPD-b stimulated, and unstimulated samples revealed higher expression of genes encoding
  cytokine receptors, transcription factors, and interferon-inducible proteins. Lower
  expression was seen for genes encoding proteins involved in antimicrobial activity,
  C-type lectin receptors, inhibition of signal transduction, and genes encoding metal
  ion transporters. Conclusions: A transcriptional signature associated with the peripheral
  blood response to PPD-b stimulation consisting of 170 genes was identified exclusively
  in the post-infection time points. Therefore, this represents a panel of potential
  biomarkers of *M. bovis* infection.'
