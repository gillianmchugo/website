abstract: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a neglected
  tropical disease caused by infection with trypanosome parasites (*Trypanosoma* spp.).
  These are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (*Glossina* spp.) and cause a similar
  disease in animals, known as African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT). AAT is one of
  the largest constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and causes
  a financial burden of approximately $4.5 billion annually. Some African *Bos taurus*
  cattle populations have an important evolutionary adaptation known as trypanotolerance,
  a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites (*Trypanosoma*
  spp.). Trypanotolerant African *B. taurus* N’Dama and trypanosusceptible *Bos indicus*
  Boran cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when
  gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples
  with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern
  of parasitaemia exhibited during trypanosome infection. However, differences in
  response to infection between the two breeds were reflected in differential expression
  of genes related to the immune system such as those encoding antimicrobial peptides
  and cytokines, including, for example, the antimicrobial peptide encoding genes
  *LEAP2*, *CATHL3*, *DEFB4A*, and *S100A7* and the cytokine genes *CCL20*, *CXCL11*, *CXCL13*,
  *CXCL16*, *CXCL17*, *IL33*, and *TNFSF13B*. In addition, transcriptional profiling of peripheral
  blood identified expression differences in genes relating to coagulation and iron
  homeostasis, which supports the hypothesis that the dual control of parasitaemia
  and the anaemia resulting from the innate immune response to trypanosome parasites
  is key to trypanotolerance and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms
  underlying this phenomenon.
