abstract: 'Canine demodicosis is a prevalent skin disease caused by overpopulation
  of a commensal species of *Demodex* mite, yet its precise cause remains unknown. Research
  suggests that T-cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction
  of regulatory T cells and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may
  contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding
  of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry
  and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum
  stress promotes canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling
  pathways: *eIF2*, *mTOR*, and *eIF4* and *p70S6K*. These pathways are involved in the modulation
  of Toll-like receptors, most notably *TLR2*, and have been shown to play a role in
  the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways
  are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages.
  Immunohistochemical analysis, utilising common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages,
  verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis
  also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities and inflammatory
  response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with
  canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that *Demodex* mites, through ER stress,
  unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment, thereby assisting in their proliferation.'
