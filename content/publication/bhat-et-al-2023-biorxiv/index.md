abstract: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with *Mycobacterium bovis*,
  continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well
  as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes
  to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study,
  high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential
  gene expression in γδ T cells – a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive
  immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. γδ T cell subsets
  are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as *Workshop
  Cluster 1* (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and
  function of specific γδ T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally
  *M. bovis*-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT)
  and IFN-γ ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian
  cattle. γδ T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (*n*
  = 10–12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte
  subset (WC1.1<sup>+</sup>, WC1.2<sup>+</sup>, WC1<sup>-</sup> and γδ<sup>-</sup>) was used to generate transcriptomes using
  bulk RNA-seq (*n* = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively
  low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most
  cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in
  the *M. bovis*-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1<sup>+</sup> γδ T cell compartment
  (absolute log<sub>2</sub> FC ≥ 1.5 and FDR *P*<sub>adj.</sub> ≤ 0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were
  significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB+ cattle and included
  genes encoding transcription factors (*TBX21* and *EOMES*), chemokine receptors (*CCR5*
  and *CCR7*), granzymes (*GZMA*, *GZMM*, and *GZMH*) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like
  receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation
  analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell
  activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion,
  WC1.1<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle,
  and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific
  subset in cattle naturally infected with *M. bovis*.
