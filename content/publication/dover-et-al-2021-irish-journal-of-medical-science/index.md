abstract: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of increasing importance in humans
  and cattle, causing significant mortality, morbidity, and economic loss worldwide.
  The rise of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)
  is of particular concern. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (the primary cause of human
  TB) and *Mycobacterium bovis* (the primary cause of bovine TB) are remarkably similar
  at the genome sequence level. In the face of this, it is important to understand
  the molecular mechanisms underpinning host responses to infection with these pathogens.
  This will have implications for diagnosis, vaccinology, and treatment of human TB
  and for disease control and management of bovine TB.<br><br>In the present study, differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) within active functional modules (subnetworks) were analysed<sup>1</sup>.
  These DEGs were identified using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of human and bovine alveolar
  macrophages (hAM and bAM) 24 hours post infection (hpi) with *M. tuberculosis* and
  *M. bovis*, respectively. Following this, Ingenuity<sup>®</sup> Pathway Analysis (IPA<sup>®</sup>) was used
  to systematically extract enriched molecular pathways involved in host responses
  to infection<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>Table 1 shows an overview of some of the key findings in this study.
  The results were multifaceted and complex and encompassed many aspects of host-pathogen
  interactions, including pathogen recognition, cell signalling and downstream inflammatory
  processes. This study provides further evidence to help frame future research questions
  that will be vital to developing a complete understanding of host-pathogen interactions
  for pathogenic mycobacterial infections of humans and cattle.
