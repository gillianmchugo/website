abstract: Animal domestication has fascinated biologists since Charles Darwin first
  drew the parallel between evolution via natural selection and human-mediated breeding
  of livestock and companion animals. In this review we show how studies of ancient
  DNA from domestic animals and their wild progenitors and congeners have shed new
  light on the genetic origins of domesticates, and on the process of domestication
  itself. High-resolution paleogenomic data sets now provide unprecedented opportunities
  to explore the development of animal agriculture across the world. In addition,
  functional population genomics studies of domestic and wild animals can deliver
  comparative information useful for understanding recent human evolution.
