abstract: Domestic cattle have a key economic role in African societies, providing
  an important source of mobile wealth through supply of meat, milk, cowhide, fuel,
  transport, and traction. The phenotypic diversity of African cattle reflects adaptation
  to a wide range of agroecological conditions and complex patterns of admixture between
  the humpless *Bos taurus* (taurine) and humped *Bos indicus* (zebu) subspecies, which
  share a common ancestor 150-500 thousand years ago. Human migration and trade from
  Asia have left a peak of zebu nuclear ancestry in East Africa and most cattle populations
  across the continent have a hybrid genetic composition. Notwithstanding this, all
  African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant
  zebu nuclear ancestry. In this regard, the efficient functioning of the mitochondrion
  relies on a network of biochemical interactions between the products of 37 mitochondrial
  genes and more than one thousand nuclear genes; therefore, admixed African cattle
  represent ideal populations for evaluating mitonuclear interactions and mismatch
  between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Using high-density SNP array data
  from 18 different cattle populations, including ten African admixed breeds, we find
  strong evidence for mitonuclear coevolution in hybrid African cattle with significant
  retention of *Bos taurus* alleles at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes, particularly
  those genes with products that directly interact with mtDNA-encoded protein subunits
  in OXPHOS and ribosomal complexes, or that have functions in mtDNA replication.
  We also show that subspecific local ancestry varies substantially across the genomes
  of admixed populations, with a marked signal of taurine ancestry at the major histocompatibility
  (MHC) gene cluster, which likely reflects adaptation to infectious disease challenges
  facing African livestock. Our results demonstrate that African admixed cattle represent
  an excellent comparative model for studying the phenotypic consequences of mitonuclear
  mismatch and genomic introgression in humans and other large mammals.
