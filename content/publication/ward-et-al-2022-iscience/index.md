abstract: The phenotypic diversity of African cattle reflects adaptation to a wide
  range of agroecological conditions, human-mediated selection preferences, and complex
  patterns of admixture between the humpless *Bos taurus* (taurine) and humped *Bos indicus*
  (zebu) subspecies, which diverged 150-500 thousand years ago. Despite extensive
  admixture, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations
  with significant zebu biparental and male uniparental nuclear ancestry. This has
  been interpreted as the result of human-mediated dispersal ultimately stemming from
  zebu bulls imported from South Asia during the last three millennia. Here, we assess
  whether ancestry at mitochondrially targeted nuclear genes in African admixed cattle
  is impacted by mitonuclear functional interactions. Using high-density SNP data,
  we find evidence for mitonuclear coevolution across hybrid African cattle populations
  with a significant increase of taurine ancestry at mitochondrially targeted nuclear
  genes. Our results, therefore, support the hypothesis of incompatibility between
  the taurine mitochondrial genome and the zebu nuclear genome.
