abstract: Criollo cattle, the descendants of animals brought by Iberian colonists
  to the Americas, have been the subject of natural and human-mediated selection in
  novel tropical agroecological zones for centuries. Consequently, these breeds have
  evolved distinct characteristics such as resistance to diseases and exceptional
  heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been
  proposed that gene flow from African taurine and Asian indicine (*Bos indicus*) cattle
  has shaped the ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds
  from Colombia and Venezuela using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) array data to examine population structure and admixture at high
  resolution. Analysis of genetic structure and ancestry components provided evidence
  for African taurine and Asian indicine admixture in Criollo cattle. In addition,
  using WGS data, we detected selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive
  traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, immunity
  and distinct coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores the remarkable
  adaptability of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness and potential
  of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux and disease challenges.
  Further research is warranted to leverage these findings for more effective and
  sustainable cattle breeding programmes.
