abstract: Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian settlers to the
  Americas, are a group of breeds that have been subjected to centuries of natural
  and sometimes human-mediated selection in novel agroecological zones. This has resulted
  in populations that are uniquely adapted to the diverse environments found in Latin
  America and the Caribbean. Criollo cattle exhibit distinct characteristics such
  as a resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European
  taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been proposed that Criollo cattle have experienced
  gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (*Bos indicus*) populations. In this
  study we analysed three Criollo breeds (Blanco Orejinegro and Hartón del Valle from
  Colombia , and Limonero from Venezuela) using whole genome sequencing data to examine
  population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We also examined selection
  signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to
  thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, and immunity. Our results also provided
  evidence of artificial selection, particularly for distinct coat and skin coloration
  traits. We did not detect evidence for historical African taurine admixture in Criollo
  cattle; however, there was evidence of uniform admixture between the Hartón del
  Valle breed and zebu cattle. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability
  of Criollo cattle, driven by both natural and human-mediated selection. It highlights
  the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change,
  habitat flux, and disease challenges. Further research is warranted to validate
  and leverage these findings for more effective and sustainable cattle breeding programmes.
