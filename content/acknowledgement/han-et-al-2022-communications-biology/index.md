abstract: Selection for system-wide morphological, physiological, and metabolic adaptations
  has led to extreme athletic phenotypes among geographically diverse horse breeds.
  Here, we identify genes contributing to exercise adaptation in racehorses by applying
  genomics approaches for racing performance, an end-point athletic phenotype. Using
  an integrative genomics strategy to first combine population genomics results with
  skeletal muscle exercise and training transcriptomic data, followed by whole-genome
  resequencing of Asian horses, we identify protein-coding variants in genes of interest
  in galloping racehorse breeds (Arabian, Mongolian and Thoroughbred). A core set
  of genes, *G6PC2*, *HDAC9*, *KTN1*, *MYLK2*, *NTM*, *SLC16A1* and *SYNDIG1*, with central roles
  in muscle, metabolism, and neurobiology, are key drivers of the racing phenotype.
  Although racing potential is a multifactorial trait, the genomic architecture shaping
  the common athletic phenotype in horse populations bred for racing provides evidence
  for the influence of protein-coding variants in fundamental exercise-relevant genes.
  Variation in these genes may therefore be exploited for genetic improvement of horse
  populations towards specific types of racing.

### Abstract
Selection for system-wide morphological, physiological, and metabolic adaptations has led to extreme athletic phenotypes among geographically diverse horse breeds. Here, we identify genes contributing to exercise adaptation in racehorses by applying genomics approaches for racing performance, an end-point athletic phenotype. Using an integrative genomics strategy to first combine population genomics results with skeletal muscle exercise and training transcriptomic data, followed by whole-genome resequencing of Asian horses, we identify protein-coding variants in genes of interest in galloping racehorse breeds (Arabian, Mongolian and Thoroughbred). A core set of genes, *G6PC2*, *HDAC9*, *KTN1*, *MYLK2*, *NTM*, *SLC16A1* and *SYNDIG1*, with central roles in muscle, metabolism, and neurobiology, are key drivers of the racing phenotype. Although racing potential is a multifactorial trait, the genomic architecture shaping the common athletic phenotype in horse populations bred for racing provides evidence for the influence of protein-coding variants in fundamental exercise-relevant genes. Variation in these genes may therefore be exploited for genetic improvement of horse populations towards specific types of racing.
