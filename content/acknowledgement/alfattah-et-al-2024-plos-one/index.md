abstract: During the oestrous cycle, the bovine endometrium undergoes morphological
  and functional changes, which are regulated by alterations in the levels of oestrogen
  and progesterone and consequent changes in gene expression. To clarify these changes
  before and after oestrus, RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of oestrus-synchronized
  beef heifers. Endometrial samples were collected from 29 animals, which were slaughtered
  in six groups beginning 12 h after the withdrawal of intravaginal progesterone releasing
  devices until seven days post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). The groups represented
  proestrus, early oestrus, metoestrus and early dioestrus (luteal phase). Changes
  in gene expression were estimated relative to gene expression at oestrus. Ingenuity<sup>®</sup>
  Pathway Analysis (IPA<sup>®</sup>) was used to identify canonical pathways and functional processes
  of biological importance. A total of 5,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  were identified. The lowest number of DEGs was observed at the 12 h post-oestrus
  time point, whereas the greatest number was observed at Day 7 post-oestrus onset
  (luteal phase). A total of 2,748 DEGs at this time point did not overlap with any
  other time points. Prior to oestrus, Neurological disease and Organismal injury
  and abnormalities appeared among the top IPA<sup>®</sup> diseases and functions categories,
  with upregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Lipid metabolism was upregulated
  before oestrus and downregulated at 48h post-oestrus, at which point an upregulation
  of immune-related pathways was observed. In contrast, in the luteal phase the Lipid
  metabolism and Small molecule biochemistry pathways were upregulated.

### Abstract
During the oestrous cycle, the bovine endometrium undergoes morphological and functional changes, which are regulated by alterations in the levels of oestrogen and progesterone and consequent changes in gene expression. To clarify these changes before and after oestrus, RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of oestrus-synchronized beef heifers. Endometrial samples were collected from 29 animals, which were slaughtered in six groups beginning 12 h after the withdrawal of intravaginal progesterone releasing devices until seven days post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). The groups represented proestrus, early oestrus, metoestrus and early dioestrus (luteal phase). Changes in gene expression were estimated relative to gene expression at oestrus. Ingenuity<sup>®</sup> Pathway Analysis (IPA<sup>®</sup>) was used to identify canonical pathways and functional processes of biological importance. A total of 5,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The lowest number of DEGs was observed at the 12 h post-oestrus time point, whereas the greatest number was observed at Day 7 post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). A total of 2,748 DEGs at this time point did not overlap with any other time points. Prior to oestrus, Neurological disease and Organismal injury and abnormalities appeared among the top IPA<sup>®</sup> diseases and functions categories, with upregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Lipid metabolism was upregulated before oestrus and downregulated at 48h post-oestrus, at which point an upregulation of immune-related pathways was observed. In contrast, in the luteal phase the Lipid metabolism and Small molecule biochemistry pathways were upregulated.
